# Evidence-Based Practice in Physiotherapy for Parkinson’s Disease in Germany

## About This Project

Welcome!
  
This project investigates adherence to evidence-based practice (EBP) in the physiotherapeutic care of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in Germany.

Despite the growing body of evidence and the availability of national and European guidelines for Parkinson-specific physiotherapy, little is known about how consistently these recommendations are translated into daily clinical practice. Evidence-based practice is a complex construct that extends beyond guideline awareness and encompasses professional attitudes, structural resources, behavioral control, social norms and the integration of patient-centered decision-making.
In this project, EBP adherence is conceptualized as an integrative decision-making model and operationalized as the self-reported integration of evidence-based decision-making principles and patient-centered care. To date, no study has comprehensively examined these dimensions within the context of physiotherapy for Parkinson’s disease in Germany.

This project aims to systematically examine:
  
1. How strongly evidence-based practice is implemented in Parkinson-specific physiotherapy in Germany, and
2. Which individual, structural and contextual factors influence EBP adherence.

This project originates from the "Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation" working group at the Department of Neurology at Philipps University of Marburg. An anonymous online questionnaire was developed to collect data on:

- Sociodemographic and professional characteristics
- Implementation dimensions of evidence-based practice
- Integration of patient-centered decision-making
- Barriers to evidence- based practice, including:
   - Patient-related barriers
   - Structural workplace conditions 
   - Physiotherapist-related barriers
- Interdisciplinary collaboration

## Use of Large Language Models

This project made limited use of large language models to assist with code formatting, refactoring, and documentation. The models served as a technical support tool and did not replace human judgment. All analyses, statistical modeling, and scientific conclusions were designed, verified, and interpreted by the authors. Responsibility for the correctness and integrity of the code and results lies entirely with the authors.
